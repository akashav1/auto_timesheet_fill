This is a code where you can easily fill you timesheet with just one click. No need to worry about selecting each day and then select the time. <br>
Your work is very simple just fill out the excel sheet and then when you are ready just run the python code it will automatically fill the timesheet<br>
I have also integrated this code with google home so when I say "Ok Google fill my timesheet" it fills my timesheet automatically<br><br>
Things you need to do are<br>
•	Install selenium driver for python<br>
•	Replace the #your_company_website” with you company website<br>
•	Replace the #your_username” with you username<br>
•	Replace the “#your_password” with your password<br>

If you are planning on implement this in any server then use xampp and the make the php code run your python script
