This is a code where you can easily fill you timesheet with just one click. No need to worry about selecting each day and then select the time. 
Your work is very simple just fill out the excel sheet and then when you are ready just run the python code it will automatically fill the timesheet
I have also integrated this code with google home so when I say "Ok Google fill my timesheet" it fills my timesheet automatically
